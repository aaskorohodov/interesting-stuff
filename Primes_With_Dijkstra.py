"""
This code illustrates Dijkstra's approach to gather prime-numbers from 2 to some specific number (or to determine if
a given number is prime). The algorithm itself can be seen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwxjMKBMR7s

Its implementations rely on heapq, which can create a heap from any list. This heap is a binary tree, in which we are
only interested in one of its properties - this tree has the lowest element on its top.
